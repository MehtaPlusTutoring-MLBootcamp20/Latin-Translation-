        <h3>Abstract!</h3>
        <p>We present a neural translation model specifically for Latin. Given the lack of accurate translations and resources, and the nature of the ancient language, Latin is one of the hardest languages to implement an accurate automated translation model. However, by using an accurate dataset of multiple manually translated texts with varying degrees of complexity, our model has achieved 95.48\% accuracy in processing grammar, assigning appropriate synonyms, and providing an accurate translation. Experimental results show that the proposed model performs better on both vocabulary and long sentences and thereby achieves significant BLEU score improvement on Latin-English translation tasks compared to the Google Phrase-Based NMT.</p>
